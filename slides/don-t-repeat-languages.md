##  Don&#39;t repeat languages

```bash
/de
/en-US
/es
/fr
/it
/ja
/ko
/pt-BR
/zh-CN
/zh-TW
```

note:

Here's one example. You'll start out with this, the 10 standard languages we support.

But the the testers will do something like set their browser to "English", but not specifically "US English."
