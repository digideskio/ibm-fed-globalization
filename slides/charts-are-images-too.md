note:

The idea of "images" can be fairly abstract, so here's another in our application. It shows you CPU usage over time. It's like 400 pixels. It's a globalization nightmare.

You've got numbers; you've got dates; you've got times; you've got labels. All of them have to be altered for different languages.

We were generating these with a JavaScript library and SVG on the fly. Does your charting library let you customize every string of text?
