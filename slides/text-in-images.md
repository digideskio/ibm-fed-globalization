## Text in images

note:

Everyone remember my astro dog?

You see that there's text *in* the image? That's a no-no! How do you translate that? It's baked into the file!

That means if you're using charts, graphs, screen captures, anything with text… you might have to rethink that. Or be ready to provide images with the text translated into every language you support.
