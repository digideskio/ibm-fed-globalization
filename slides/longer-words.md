note:

Did you know that the tiny little word "Save" in French becomes "Suavegarder"?

That's awesome. Don't get me started on German.

Conversely, in Chinese, those are 2 characters long.

Give up any sense that you can control even the content you think you can control.

Design your UIs for flexibility. Design for lists and collections to collapse gracefully. You can see here these buttons were side-by-side in English when they fit, but collapse above-and-below when there isn't.

DO NOT FIGHT THAT. Forget about using `width` and `height` in your CSS pretty much ever. They will always come back to bite you when your text is suddenly several times larger or smaller.

You can also push back against designers when you get mockups that assume that buttons will always be the same size.
