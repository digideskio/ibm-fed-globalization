**Wha?**

Language detection; message formatting

**Where?**

Node.js and browsers


note:

As far as I know, i18next is the de-facto standard for services on Bluemix.

We use it to control the list of supported languages, detect a user's language (more on that soon), store messages, and grab translated messages as I was showing earlier.

It runs both server-side and in the browser, which is handy so both your server and client can use the same messages.
