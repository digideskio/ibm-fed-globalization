note:

Everyone formats dates just a little bit (or a lot bit) differently.

Here's August 31, 2015 with a short datestamp in a couple of countries.

Note the different order of the numbers; the different use of 8 or zero-8; different separators expected between elements.

I love you, Canada, but you're a hot mess. Canada, depending on application, uses all of the above and then some.
