# We are not jerks

note:

Life is hard, ya know? Imagine you're trying to get something done, and then BAM some application you're trying to use starts talking to you in a language you don't understand.

Now your life is that much harder. And it didn't have to be!

Look: the only people who should be making life harder for other people are jerks, and we are not jerks here.
