#  Start early

note:

I studied personal finance in college. There's an old saying that the best time to start saving for retirement was 20 years ago; the second-best time is right now.

The same goes for thinking about translating your application.

A globalized application is not super, super different from a non-globalized application, but there are enough differences that the sooner you start planning for it, the less of a pain it will be when you wake up one morning and your PM is saying your app needs to be globalized.
