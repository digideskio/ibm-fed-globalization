##  Stop repeating languages, gosh!

```bash
/de
/en      #same as en-US
/en-US
/es
/fr
/it
/ja
/ko
/pt      #same as pt-BR
/pt-BR
/zh      #same as zh-CN
/zh-CN
/zh-Hans #same as zh-CN
/zh-Hant #same as zh-TW
/zh-TW
```

note:

Oh, except that there are sometimes two different codes for the same Chinese language, depending on the browser COUGH Internet Explorer COUGH

This doesn't even fit any more. You can see how this gets unsustainable. And you have to remember to copy the things every time. Not good.
