##  What strings look like now

`locales/en/resources.json`:

```json
{
  "backToDashboard": "Back to Dashboard",
  […]
}
```

`locales/es/resources.json`:

```json
{
  "backToDashboard": "Volver al Panel de control",
  […]
}
```


note:

So this is what strings look like now.

We keep them in a set of JSON files in a bunch of folders by language.

Those JSON files have keys like "backToDashboard"; the values are the corresponding text, in that language.
