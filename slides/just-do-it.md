# Just do it

note:

This last bit is a tiny bit controversial.

Once you start translating your product, now you've got an automatic delay: when you change or add text, it has to be translated.

Particularly very close to launch, this means you hold back on fixing things, because you might not get the translations back in time.

I try not to roll that way. If you have a fix, just do it! I think it's better to address problems immediately and push the fix, even if that leaves a small part of your product untranslated for a while.

You might disagree! That's OK! But have this discussion with your product managers, testers, and translation teams so you're all on the same page, at least.
