##  jQuery Globalize

<https://github.com/jquery/globalize>

**Wha?**

Date/time formatting; Numbers; Relative times

**Where?**

Node.js and browsers


note:

Unfortunately for us i18next doesn't do everything, so I supplement it with a relatively new library from the jQuery Foundation called "Globalize".

It helps you format dates, times, numbers, currency, relative timesâ€¦ It's pretty nice.

Don't let the name throw you: if you're one of those post-jQuery developers, jQuery is not required. It's just from the same team.

There are a bunch of other libraries, but most of the teams in our little world have settled on i18next and Globalize, and it helps to be using the same stuff so you can compare notes.
